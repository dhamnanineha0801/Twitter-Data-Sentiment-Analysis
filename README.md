**Introduction:**

Sentiment Analysis was carried out on the Twitter Data available on the kaggle Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/twitter-sentiment-dataset)

To carry out the analysis all the pre-processing steps like tokenization, pad_sequences method etc. was carried out. 
LSTM model was used to predict the sentiments which gave the accuracy of around 96%

Also to visualize the effect of the words in the text contributing to positive and negative sentiment, WordCloud graph was executed in the python (Word_Cloud.ipynb)
